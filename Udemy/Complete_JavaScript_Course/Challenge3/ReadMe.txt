   (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in separate variable)

2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
(Hint: you can read that value with the .value property in JavaScript,  this is a good opportunity to use google to figure this out)

3. Add another die to the game, so that ther are two dice now.  The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. 
(Hint; you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the css code for the first one.)
