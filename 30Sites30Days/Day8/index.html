            <p>I was blessed with the opportunity to meet Stevie Wonder back in the day when I lived (briefly) in Los Angeles.  It was a brief encounter,
            probably one of thousands he has had throughout his 50+ years as one of the leading musicians of his era.  While passionate about his craft, I was
            struck by how gracious he was with his time and how willing he was to share with us his ideas on issues such as social justice and poverty.</p>
            <p>Although generally regarded as an R&B artist, Stevie Wonder has always incorportated a number of different genre's into his music.  Touring with the Rolling
              Stones and introducing himself to their audience was a primary driver to the success of <em>"Superstition"</em>.  In additon to the harmonica and keyboards,
              Stevie Wonder has also showcased his drum abilities frequently.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout my life I have assumed a number of roles; son, brother, father, friend, husband.  Throughout this time the music of Stevie Wonder has been
              a constant.  In many ways his music has become a soundtrack of my life.
